	<p class="">The Meat Empire is a modern, hygiene and taste-focused Online Meat-delivery platform, whereon we are committed to bring you the premium quality meat & meat products, with a delightful customer experience.

		   	    	No, it isn’t just a random start-up; Infact, we (Rajora-Brothers) have been promoting quality meat
products through our 30 year old established family business - Empire, with its retail stores in Delhi-NCR.
And through these popular stores, we have consistently redefined the meat standards from time to
time.</p>
		   	   	<p class=""> At The Meat Empire, we genuinely understand what fresh and natural meat means to you, and we have
therefore included stringent quality-checks at various levels of meat-processing, which starts from
procuring right quality in the morning everyday and ends at your doorstep.</p>
		   	    		
		   	    		<p class="">
To ensure we promote and sell our products at most affordable and reasonable prices, we have
incorporated no middlemen in our supply-chain which usually is the cause of unreasonable prices that is
paid by the customers eventually.</p>
		<p class="">
Our long and elaborate range of mouth-watering recipes gets prepared in our state-of-art kitchen,
through which we are able to deliver you the variety of processed meats in Chicken, Mutton, Fish,
Prawns, Marinades, Cold-cuts, Fitness Food and Curries.
                        </p>
<p>We are currently delivering happiness in and around Noida-region and striving to create more and more
happy customers. What we want from you is your constant feedback so we remain effective in meeting
your expectations at all times.</p>
